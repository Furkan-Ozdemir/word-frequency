This is an elementary Latin course accompanied with a detailed grammar based upon Kennedy's Public School Latin Grammar designed to introduce one to the world of classical languages.  A basic understanding of grammatical terminology would be helpful; however, it is not required.  Basic definitions of terms will be explained in Lessons 1 and 2, and later elaborated as needed.
For detailed explanations and examples of English grammatical terms, please consult the English Grammar textbook.  However, Latin grammar is quite different from that of English, and thus it requires different grammatical terms to explain the concepts.  These will be taught as needed.

All Wikibooks are written in the particular English dialect of the writer, which may not be standard usage. If you see something particularly unclear, please feel free to correct it, but please alter this article in a constructive manner.
This book will attempt to teach the reader Latin from the ground up. Please read the Introduction carefully, as it introduces the concept of a stem. As is typical in many other languages, the infinitive stem (present tense, active voice) is used for conjugating verbs. [The introduction of additional information in parentheses is done simply to avoid confusing a student who has already had exposure to Latin.]
If something doesn't make sense to you delete what you don't understand, e.g., "grade 12 [grade]  American [system] revert?" The "revert" keyword allows your editors to know that you are not a skilled editor but are just trying to learn, and are confused. Your changes are not permanent.

As this is a textbook, readers will want denotational indication of macrons. If you do not know how to do this in HTML, please refer to Wikipedia's article on the topic.Nouns should be given in the nominative and genitive singular following the standard practice of Latin dictionaries. If it is necessary to indicate the case of the declension then the abbreviations "nom." and "gen." may be used. Different pages may use their own layout rules, but they should be left-justified and clear to the student.Check with other commercial textbooks and study guides to see if what you are doing is factually accurate and pedagogically sound. Wikibooks trusts you to make that judgment on your own, but this is a book - not an article.
